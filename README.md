## About

ookscraft is a modpack built around the Create mod, combining automation,
exploration, and visual enhancements. Designed for my personal server, it offers
a polished experience with performance optimization at its core through Fabric's
ecosystem. The infrastructure for this project is managed with nix and packwiz.

## Key features

### Create ecosystem:

An extensive collection of Create modules and addons that expand automation and
engineering possibilities:

- Core automation with Create
- Tech expansions like Crafts & Additions and Enchantment Industry
- Quality-of-life additions such as Goggles, Jetpack, and Utilities
- Building enhancements through Deco, Framed, and Extended Cogwheels
- Trading and villager improvements with Better Villagers and Trading Floor

### Enhanced world generation:

- Terralith and Tectonic for diverse and immersive biomes
- YUNG's Better series for improved structures and dungeons

### Visuals:

- Comprehensive 3D resource pack collection
- Complementary Reimagined shaders
- Enhanced foliage with Better Leaves
- Realistic effects through Effective
